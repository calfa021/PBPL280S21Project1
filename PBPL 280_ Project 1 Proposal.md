### Team identification: Jenny Chen, Niloufar Nasrollahzadeh, Haley Welch, Chelsy Alfaro, Samantha Stackelhouse, Danielle Rucker, Eddie Garcia Ramirez 

# Topic: Neighborhood Change and Schools

# Research question: Do high school graduation rates vary based on neighborhood demographics (rural vs. urban)?
 Riverside + San Bernardino County 
 - Neighborhood funding
 - Crime rates + safety 
 - Size of school district 
 - School demographics 
 - Median income rates 
 - Median household income 
 - Parent education level
 - Parent occupation 
 - Urban planning- zoning policy 
 - Cost of living



# Data sets:
- GeoSNAP
